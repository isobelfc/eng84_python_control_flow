# Control Flow
- Conditional statements are used to control the flow of our program

## If, elif, else
- `if` checks whether a condition is met, and executes a block of code if it is met
- If the first conditional statement is not met, `elif` checks whether another condition is met, and executes if it is
- Multiple `elif`s may be present, and each one is checked in order until one is met and executes
- If none of the conditions are met, the `else` block is executed

## For loops
## While loops
